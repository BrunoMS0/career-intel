# Career Intelligence Assistant

A hiring assignment: a RAG app that answers questions about one resume against
several job postings ("What skills am I missing for Job #2?"). Repo:
https://github.com/BrunoMS0/career-intel

## Working agreement

- Code and code comments in English. Conversation with the user in Spanish.
- The user writes `README.md` themselves. Do not add setup docs or decision
  write-ups to it — the assignment grades their own reasoning, not generated
  prose. Correcting a factual error in it is welcome; rewriting it is not.
- Work phase by phase, confirming before starting the next one.
- Commit messages: short, lowercase, plain words. No `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- Prefer measuring over asserting. Several decisions below were settled by
  running the thing against the real corpus, and that evidence is the point.

## Stack

| Piece | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript | assignment asks fullstack |
| DB | Postgres 17 + pgvector 0.8.6 (Docker) | relational data and vectors in one container, metadata filters in the same `WHERE` as the search |
| Embeddings | `gemini-embedding-001`, 1536 dims | OpenAI account had no credits; Gemini's free tier also gives asymmetric `taskType` |
| LLM | `gemini-3.7-flash` via `CHAT_MODEL` | free tier; pinned, not an alias, so eval runs stay comparable |
| PDF | `unpdf` | no native deps, keeps the image small |
| SQL | `postgres` (postgres.js), raw SQL | three tables; `db/schema.sql` runs on container init, no migration toolchain |
| Tests | `node --test` | stdlib, no framework |

## Layout

- `lib/pdf.ts` — text extraction, rebuilds reading order from glyph positions
- `lib/chunk.ts` — section-aware chunker, `enrich()`, `unlabeledShare()`
- `lib/embedding.ts` — `embedForIndex()` / `embedForQuery()`, deliberately paired
- `lib/retrieval.ts` — scope resolution and the search + parent-expansion query
- `lib/ingest.ts` — parse, chunk, embed, store in one transaction
- `app/api/{health,documents,chat}/route.ts`, `app/workspace.tsx` — UI
- `scripts/` — `pnpm inspect <pdf>`, `pnpm retrieve "<question>"`

## Commands

```
docker compose up -d                  # Postgres + pgvector
pnpm dev                              # app on :3000
pnpm test                             # chunker and pdf tests
pnpm inspect <file.pdf> [--text]      # how a PDF chunks, without indexing it
pnpm retrieve "<question>"            # what a question retrieves, with distances
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d career_intel
```

## Decisions worth not relitigating

**Structure-based chunking, hand-rolled.** Sections are semantic here, not
decorative: "5+ years of React" under a posting's requirements means the role
wants it, under the resume's experience means the candidate has it. JS chunking
libraries (`@langchain/textsplitters`, `chonkie`) only split by size or
embedding similarity and would drop the section label entirely. Docling does
solve section detection, but it is Python — `docling-sdk` on npm is only a
bridge to the Python CLI or a hosted service, so adopting it adds a second
runtime to the container story. Revisit with eval numbers.

**Headings by vocabulary, caps, and list structure — not font size.** Font size
looked like the better signal and was measured against both real documents: the
resume's headings run 13pt over a 9.5pt body (1.37x) while its job titles run
10.5pt (1.10x), and the posting's headings are 13pt over 11pt (1.18x). Any
threshold catching the posting also promotes every employer in the resume to a
section. The rule that generalised instead: a short Title Case line directly
above a bullet list is a heading — resumes put the employer there, postings put
a list.

**No overlap between chunks.** Every cut lands on a paragraph or bullet
boundary, so there is no mid-thought break to repair.

**No vector index.** Under a hundred chunks scan in well under a millisecond.
Add HNSW past a few thousand rows.

**Reranking deferred** until the eval harness shows whether it helps.

## Gotchas

- Ports 5432 and 5433 are taken by locally installed PostgreSQL 16 and 17, so
  the container binds `DB_PORT=5544`. A port clash there surfaces as "password
  authentication failed", not a connection error.
- `gemini-2.5-*` models return 404 for API keys created recently, and the
  `models` listing endpoint still lists them. Verify a model with a real call.
- Windows: use `curl.exe`, not `curl` — PowerShell aliases it to
  `Invoke-WebRequest`, whose multipart body undici rejects.
- `db/schema.sql` only runs when the volume is created. Schema changes need
  `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`.
- Internal imports inside `lib/` carry explicit `.ts` extensions so `scripts/`
  and the eval harness can import them through plain Node.

## Status

Phases 1-3 done: setup, ingestion, retrieval and grounded chat with citations.

Next, phase 4 — guardrails and observability: a score threshold that skips the
model call when retrieval comes back weak, refusal rules, and a `query_logs`
table feeding the eval. Then phase 5 (eval harness) and phase 6 (UI polish, app
Dockerfile).

Known and deliberate, not yet fixed:

- `TOP_K` is per document *kind*, so an unscoped "which role fits me best?"
  showed sections from only 2 of 6 postings. Needs top-k per document.
- `documents.content` is stored and read by nothing yet.
- Retrieval runs against the latest question only; a follow-up leaning on the
  previous turn retrieves against the wrong text.
- Answers render as plain text, so markdown shows raw `*` and `###`.
- No score threshold yet: weak retrieval still reaches the model.
